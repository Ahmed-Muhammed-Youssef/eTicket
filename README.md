# eTicket
E-Ticket is a web application that I built using ASP.NET Core MVC. I created it to learn more about MVC web applications. The application is simple and allows users to buy movie tickets through online payment, using PayPal as the payment gateway. The admin can access all the usersâ€™ orders and decide what to do with them.
## Problems I Encountered
* PayPal SDK: Since PayPal does not have an updated SDK for .NET, I had to use the JavaScript API. The code for the PayPal service could be polished to improve its readability. 
## Technologies
* ASP.NET Core MVC
* EF Core
* Identity
* Bootstrap v5
* PayPal
